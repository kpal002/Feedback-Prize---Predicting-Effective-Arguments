# Feedback-Prize---Predicting-Effective-Arguments
Kagle competition to classify argumentative elements in student writing as "effective," "adequate," or "ineffective." 


Goal of the Competition

The goal of this competition is to classify argumentative elements in student writing as "effective," "adequate," or "ineffective." You will create a model trained on data that is representative of the 6th-12th grade population in the United States in order to minimize bias. Models derived from this competition will help pave the way for students to receive enhanced feedback on their argumentative writing. With automated guidance, students can complete more assignments and ultimately become more confident, proficient writers.
